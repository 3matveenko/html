                            <h2>China Covid: Area around world's biggest iPhone plant locked down</h2>
                        
                            Chinese authorities have locked down a district in Zhengzhou city - which is home to the world's largest iPhone factory - under the country's strict coronavirus measures.

The lockdown started on Wednesday and is set to last for seven days.

The move may have an impact on production of the new iPhone 14, which is made at Foxconn's plant in the city.

Chinese people and businesses are continuing to grapple with President Xi Jinping's rigid zero-Covid policy.
